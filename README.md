## Project 10: Dataflow with AWS Airflow and Kinesis Services airflow-dags

The objective of this project is to automate data processing using an orchestration pipeline. Source code is maintained in GitHub, where changes trigger workflows executed by Airflow. Airflow handles scheduling, processing, and running tasks, and the final processed data or artifacts are stored in Amazon S3 for downstream use. This setup provides a reproducible, scalable, and automated data engineering workflow.
